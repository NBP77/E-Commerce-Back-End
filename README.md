# E-Commerce-Back-End
A backend API e-commerce application 

## Description

The main goal of this project was to create a fully functional backed-end app that is connected to mySQL and is up and running using Insomnia 
 
The User is set up for success from the beginning only having to npm start to start the server up

Once the server is up an running the user has the option to view current products that have been placed in by seeds and ever added products as well

The user can use POST, GET, PUT and DELETE to any product 

All of the product information is stored directly into mySQL where each item is given its own ID
